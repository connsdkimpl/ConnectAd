# ConnectAd for iOS(Swift)
## Installation
### Installation with CocoaPods
[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like the ConnectAdSDK in your projects. You can install it with the following command:
```
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

**Podfile**  To integrate ConnectAd into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your Podfile:
```
pod 'ConnectAd', :git => 'https://github.com/connsdkimpl/ConnectAd.git'

```

Then, run the following command:
```
$ pod install
```
Note: Make sure  [ConnectAd](https://github.com/connsdkimpl/ConnectAd) is public.

## Integration
### 1. Configure Ad Units in Your App
In your appâ€™s `AppDelegate.swift` file, in  `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method,  use the following code:
```
ConnectAd.shared.connectAdInit("APP_ID"){ (result, error) -> () in
      if let error = error {
        print(error.localizedDescription)
      } else {
        print(result)
      }

    }
```
### 2. Loading Banner Ads
First, import the SDK into your ViewController.

```
import ConnectAd
```

There are two ways to create a **ConnectAdBanner** as below,

 - programmatically:

```	
var banner = ConnectAdBanner(frame: BANNER_FRAME)
```


 - xib/storyboard:
Create a **UIView** in storyboard and change its class to **ConnectAdBanner**. Connect the object to your ```UIViewController``` to use it.
```
@IBOutlet  weak  var banner: ConnectAdBanner!
```
	
Initialise the following properties to your ConnectAdBanner.

```
banner.adMobConnectIds = ["ADMOB_BANNER_CONNECT_ID_1", "ADMOB_BANNER_CONNECT_ID_2"]
banner.moPubConnectIds = ["MOPUB_BANNER_CONNECT_ID_1", "MOPUB_BANNER_CONNECT_ID_2"]
banner.rootViewController = self
banner.delegate = self
self.view.addSubview(banner)  
```
Whenever you need to present your banner, call ```loadAds()``` of your **ConnectAdBanner** to load and display a banner ad.
```
banner.loadAds()
```
Note: If you don't have any of the CONNECT_IDs, then there is no need to set values to corresponding properties.

### 3. Loading Interstitial Ads
First, import the SDK into your ViewController.

```
import ConnectAd
```

Create a **ConnectAdInterstitial** instance:
```
var interstitial = ConnectAdInterstitial()
banner.adMobConnectIds = ["ADMOB_INTERSTITIAL_CONNECT_ID_1", "ADMOB_INTERSTITIAL_CONNECT_ID_2"]
banner.moPubConnectIds = ["MOPUB_INTERSTITIAL_CONNECT_ID_1", "MOPUB_INTERSTITIAL_CONNECT_ID_2"]
interstitial.delegate = self
```
Whenever you need to show your interstitial ad, call ```loadFrom()``` of your **ConnectAdInterstitial** to load and display the same.
```
interstitial.loadFrom(self)
```
Note: If you don't have any of the CONNECT_IDs, then there is no need to set values to corresponding properties.

### 4. Loading Rewarded Video Ads
First, import the SDK into your ViewController.

```
import ConnectAd
```

Create a **ConnectAdRewarded** instance:
```
var rewardedVideo = ConnectAdRewarded()
rewardedVideo.adMobConnectIds = ["ADMOB_REWARDED_CONNECT_ID_1", "ADMOB_REWARDED_CONNECT_ID_2"]
rewardedVideo.moPubConnectIds = ["MOPUB_REWARDED_CONNECT_ID_1", "MOPUB_REWARDED_CONNECT_ID_2"]
rewardedVideo.delegate = self
```
Whenever you need to show your interstitial ad, call ```loadFrom()``` of your **ConnectAdRewarded** to load and display the same.
```
rewardedVideo.loadFrom(self)
```
Note: If you don't have any of the CONNECT_IDs, then there is no need to set values to corresponding properties.

### 5. Implementing Delegates
#### Conform your ViewController to ```ConnectAdBannerDelegate``` protocol and implement all the methods.
```
extension MyViewController: ConnectAdBannerDelegate {
  func onBannerDone(_ adType: AdType) {
  	print("Banner received ad from:\(adType)")
  }
  func onBannerFailed(adType: AdType, error: Error) {
  	print("Banner ad error from:\(adType), Error:\(error.localizedDescription)")
  }
  func onBannerClicked(_ adType: AdType) {
  	print("Banner OnClick \(adType)")
  }
  func onBannerExpanded(_ adType: AdType) {
  	print("Banner will present \(adType)")
  }
  func onBannerCollapsed(_ adType: AdType) {
  	print("Banner did dismiss\(adType)")
  }
}
```
#### Conform your ViewController to ```ConnectAdInterstitialDelegate``` protocol and implement all the methods.
```
extension MyViewController: ConnectAdInterstitialDelegate {
  func connectAdInterstitialReceivedAd(_ adType: AdType) {
  	print("Interstitial video received \(adType)")
  }
  func onInterstitialDone(_ adType: AdType) {
  	print("Interstitial video appear \(adType)")
  }
  func onInterstitialFailed(adType: AdType, error: Error) {
  	print("Interstitial video failed: Error:\(error.localizedDescription) \(adType)")
  }
  func onInterstitialClicked(_ adType: AdType) {
  	print("Interstitial video tapped \(adType)")
  }
  func onInterstitialClosed(_ adType: AdType) {
  	print("Interstitial video disappear \(adType)")
  }
}
```
#### Conform your ViewController to ```ConnectAdRewardedDelegate``` protocol and implement all the methods.
```
extension MyViewController: ConnectAdRewardedDelegate {
  func onRewardFail(adType: AdType, error: Error) {
  	print("RewardedVideo failed to load:\(adType), Error:\(error.localizedDescription)")
  }
  func onRewardVideoStarted(_ adType: AdType) {
  	print("RewardedVideo started playing \(adType)")
  }
  func onRewardedVideoCompleted(_ adType: AdType) {
  	print("RewardedVideo completed playing \(adType)")
  }
  func onRewardVideoClosed(_ adType: AdType) {
  	print("RewardedVideo closed \(adType)")
  }
  func onRewarded(adType: AdType, rewardItem: ConnectAdReward) {
  	print("Rewarded: \(adType), amount\(rewardItem.rewardAmount), type\(rewardItem.rewardType)")
  }
  func onRewardVideoClicked(_ adType: AdType) {
  	print("RewardedVideo video tapped \(adType)")
  }
}
```
